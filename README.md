# korg.py: WORK IN PROGRESS

`korg` is a python package for performing fast 1D LTE stellar spectral synthesis.
Under the hood, it uses the [Korg.jl](https://github.com/ajwheeler/Korg.jl) julia package.

# Supported Python Versions

For now, we only support python 3.12 and newer. Starting in the fourth quarter of 2025, we plan to adhere to [spec-0](https://scientific-python.org/specs/spec-0000/).
